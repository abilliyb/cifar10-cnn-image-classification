# CIFAR-10 CNN Image Classification

This project implements a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization, ReLU activation, and max pooling, followed by fully connected layers.

Key features:
- Data augmentation (random crop, flip, normalization) to improve generalization
- Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss for effective training
- Achieves stable performance with clear convergence on validation set

This project is intended as a hands-on exercise for deep learning model implementation and optimization.
